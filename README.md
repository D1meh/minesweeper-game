# HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME

In order to give to this program the 2 arguments it needs to launch itself, you have to launch it from a terminal
The two arguments are, in this order : number of rows/columns (int > 0) and number of bombs (int > 0 as well)
If less or more than 2 arguments are given, or if your arguments doesn't match the requirements, the game won't launch

Then, it's just a classic Minesweeper game, just like everyone knows
In order to win, you have to find all the squares with no bombs inside, with the help of the hints given when a square is right next to a bomb (for example, a 1 means that there exactly 1 bomb in all the squares around it)
If you manage to find all the squares with no bombs, you win! But if you dare to find just a bomb, you lost :(
Use left click to reveal a square, and right click to mark a square with a flag (preventing you from opening it until you remove it, which is useful if you think that a bomb is hidden in the square)

Good luck and have fun!
